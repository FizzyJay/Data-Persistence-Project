# Data-Persistence-Project
This is a project from the Learn Unity "Junior Programmer" pathway. The project was to develop an understanding of data persistence in Unity.
The game itself was not made by me but is the provided example game. I merely added UI and persistence elements, such as high score tracking and a main menu.
It was good practice, really upped the ante over the previous lessons in this pathway.
